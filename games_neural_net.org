* The Games

** TIC TAC TOE

*** The Game Board

The *Tic-tac-toe* board and game loop are of quite easy implementation.
Everyone knows the board is just a simple 3 by 3 grid, where the players
are able to put the symbols "X" and "O", that help distinguish /player/
/1/ from /player 2/.
The board will be presented as lists within lists, the reason for this 
being that is easier to change and alter lists compared to tuples. I Also 
built a function that is able to generate any kind of grid board of any 
size.

As you can see in the following piece of code, we are able to build
and present in ASCII a *Tic-tac-toe* game board.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both
import tic_tac_toe as tic

board = tic.build_board(3,3)
tic.print_board(board)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 
: +-+-+-+
: | | | |
: +-+-+-+
: | | | |
: +-+-+-+
: | | | |
: +-+-+-+

#+begin_src python :results output

#+end_src
