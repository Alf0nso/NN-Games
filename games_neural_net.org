* The Boards

** TIC TAC TOE

Tic tac toe board and game are of quite easy implementation.
Just a couple of lines of python and we have it!
The board will be presented as a list with lists, the reason
for this being that is easier to build a function able
to construct any kind of strategy board that could possibly
be used in other games

#+begin_src python :results output
import tic_tac_toe as tic

board = tic.build_board(3,3)
tic.print_board(board)
#+end_src
