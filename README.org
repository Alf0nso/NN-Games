The purpose of the project is to better understand,
how neural networks work from top to bottom. To do
that we built a mini library in python to create
and train a Multilayer Perceptron on a simple problem.
The problem we choose was to approximate a reasonable
player of a strategy board game.

* Showcase

To see the final results to this moment, you can
simply run the file /"main.py"/ where you will be
presented with a prompt. This will allow you to 
choose to play against the two neural networks 
that where train, or to simulate games between
both neural networks and random generated moves.
